    <mat-card-title>Welcome to our Privacy Policy</mat-card-title>
    <mat-card-subtitle>Your privacy is critically important to us.</mat-card-subtitle>
    <mat-card-content>
        <p>It is NEAN's policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect while operating our
            website. This Privacy Policy applies to <a href="https://nean.io">https://nean.io</a> (hereinafter, "us",
            "we", or "https://nean.io"). We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting personally identifiable
            information you may provide us through the Website. We have adopted this privacy policy ("Privacy Policy")
            to explain what information may be collected on our Website, how we use this information, and under what
            circumstances we may disclose the information to third parties. This Privacy Policy applies only to
            information we collect through the Website and does not apply to our collection of information from other
            sources.</p>
        <p>This Privacy Policy, together with the Terms of service posted on our Website, set forth the general rules
            and policies governing your use of our Website. Depending on your activities when visiting our Website, you
            may be required to agree to additional terms of service.</p>

        <h2>Website Visitors</h2>
        <p>Like most website operators, NEAN collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web
            browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring
            site, and the date and time of each visitor request. NEAN's purpose in collecting non-personally identifying
            information is to better understand how NEAN's visitors use its website. From time to time, NEAN may release
            non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage
            of its website.</p>
        <p>NEAN also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for
            logged in users and for users leaving comments on https://nean.io blog posts. NEAN only discloses logged in
            user and commenter IP addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses
            personally-identifying information as described below.</p>

        <h2>Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information</h2>
        <p>Certain visitors to NEAN's websites choose to interact with NEAN in ways that require NEAN to gather
            personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that NEAN gathers depends on the
            nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who sign up for a blog at https://nean.io to provide
            a username and email address.</p>

        <h2>Security</h2>
        <p>The security of your Personal Information is important to us, but remember that no method of transmission
            over the Internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure. While we strive to use commercially
            acceptable means to protect your Personal Information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>


        <h2>Links To External Sites</h2>
        <p>Our Service may contain links to external sites that are not operated by us. If you click on a third party
            link, you will be directed to that third party's site. We strongly advise you to review the Privacy Policy
            and terms of service of every site you visit.</p>
        <p>We have no control over, and assume no responsibility for the content, privacy policies or practices of any
            third party sites, products or services.</p>


        <h2>Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information</h2>
        <p>NEAN discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its
            employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to
            process it on NEAN's behalf or to provide services available at NEAN's website, and (ii) that have agreed
            not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be
            located outside of your home country; by using NEAN's website, you consent to the transfer of such
            information to them. NEAN will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and
            personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated
            organizations, as described above, NEAN discloses potentially personally-identifying and
            personally-identifying information only in response to a subpoena, court order or other governmental
            request, or when NEAN believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property
            or rights of NEAN, third parties or the public at large.</p>
        <p>If you are a registered user of https://nean.io and have supplied your email address, NEAN may occasionally
            send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with
            what's going on with NEAN and our products. We primarily use our blog to communicate this type of
            information, so we expect to keep this type of email to a minimum. If you send us a request (for example via
            a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help
            us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. NEAN takes all measures reasonably
            necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially
            personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.</p>

        <h2>Aggregated Statistics</h2>
        <p>NEAN may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its website. NEAN may display this information
            publicly or provide it to others. However, NEAN does not disclose your personally-identifying information.
