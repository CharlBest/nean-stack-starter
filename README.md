## Running Locally

Make sure you have [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/), [Neo4j](https://neo4j.com/) and [Angular CLI](https://cli.angular.io/) installed.

Neo4j note: create a local database with with username: neo4j and password: neo4j 

```sh
$ git clone git@github.com:CharlBest/nean-stack-starter.git
$ cd nean-stack-starter
$ npm install
$ npm start
```

Your app should now be running on [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/)

## Watch (hot reload)
```sh
$ npm run dev
```

## Why Heroku, GrapheneDB and Firebase for demo app hosting
Its free ;)

## Procfile
This file is [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) specific for hosting the [nean demo app](https://www.nean.io/). Delete it if your are not using Heroku

## Environment variables
Change to yours.
### Client
In the environments folder there are 2 files. one for dev and one for production. The angular CLI switches them at build time.
### Server
In the environments folder there is 1 file. In development default values are used. In production your hosting service should set process.env with the appropriate variables

Note: firebase storage has authentication on their buckets. Whitelist your url or something
